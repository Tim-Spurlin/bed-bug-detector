## Total Cost

- **Basic setup**: Approximately $84.88 (compared to $1,000-$2,000 for professional inspection)
- **With upgrades**: Approximately $113.86

All prices are approximate and may vary based on availability and promotions.

## Purchasing Tips

1. When ordering the ESP32, make sure it's the model with integrated WiFi and Bluetooth
2. The CO2 sensor (MH-Z19) is the most expensive component but critical for accurate detection
3. Consider purchasing a multi-pack of 18650 batteries if you plan to use the detector for extended periods
4. If you don't have access to a 3D printer, many online services can print the case files for a reasonable fee

## Where to Buy

All components are available on Amazon with the links provided above. Most components can be delivered within 2-3 days with Amazon Prime.

## Alternative Components

If certain components are unavailable, here are suitable alternatives:

- **ESP32 Alternative**: NodeMCU ESP8266 ($6.99) - Slightly less powerful but still compatible
- **Temperature Sensor Alternative**: DHT11 ($3.99) - Less accurate but more affordable
- **CO2 Sensor Alternative**: CCS811 Air Quality Sensor ($19.99) - Detects VOCs which bed bugs also emit

## Important Notes

- When purchasing the ESP32, ensure it comes with pre-soldered pins for easier connection
- The MH-Z19 CO2 sensor requires proper calibration (instructions in firmware)
- For reliable operation, use genuine sensors from reputable sellers
