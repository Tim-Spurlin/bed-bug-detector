## Detailed System Setup

### Hardware Assembly

For detailed step-by-step assembly instructions with photos and diagrams, please refer to the [Assembly Guide](docs/assembly-guide.md). Here's a brief overview:

1. **Prepare the ESP32**: Flash the firmware before assembly
2. **Connect the sensors**: Follow the pin mappings in the wiring guide
3. **Set up the power system**: Connect the battery and charging module
4. **Assemble the camera**: Position it correctly for optimal viewing
5. **Mount in the case**: Secure all components in the 3D printed enclosure

For complete wiring instructions, see the [Wiring Diagram](hardware/wiring-diagram.md).

### ESP32 Firmware Installation

The firmware controls all sensor operations and communication with the mobile app. It's designed to:

- Read data from temperature, CO2, and motion sensors
- Process sensor data to detect potential bed bug activity
- Control the camera for visual confirmation
- Communicate with the mobile app via WiFi
- Implement power management for longer battery life

#### Advanced Firmware Configuration

The firmware can be customized by modifying the [Configuration File](firmware/config.h):

```cpp
// WiFi settings
#define WIFI_SSID "BedBugDetector"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "detector123"

// Detection thresholds
#define DEFAULT_TEMP_THRESHOLD 1.5
#define DEFAULT_CO2_THRESHOLD 200
#define DETECTION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD 70

// Power management
#define DEEP_SLEEP_ENABLED false
#define SLEEP_DURATION_MINUTES 5
```

### Mobile App Installation

The mobile app provides a user-friendly interface for:

- Connecting to the detector
- Viewing sensor readings in real-time
- Calibrating the detection system
- Capturing images for visual inspection
- Running detection scans
- Viewing detection history
- Adjusting sensitivity settings

#### App Configuration Options

The app includes several customizable settings:

- **Temperature Threshold**: Sensitivity to temperature variations
- **CO2 Threshold**: Sensitivity to carbon dioxide levels
- **Detection Confidence**: Minimum confidence score for alerts
- **Notification Settings**: When and how to receive alerts
- **Display Units**: Celsius/Fahrenheit, metric/imperial

### System Configuration

After installation, follow these steps to configure your system:

1. **Initial Calibration**:
   ```
   # The detector must be calibrated in a clean environment
   # Place in a bed bug-free area and press the "Calibrate" button in the app
   # Wait 60 seconds for calibration to complete
   ```

2. **Configure WiFi Settings** (optional):
   ```cpp
   // Edit firmware/config.h to change WiFi settings
   #define WIFI_SSID "YourCustomName"
   #define WIFI_PASSWORD "YourCustomPassword"
   
   // Then recompile and upload the firmware
   cd bed-bug-detector/firmware
   arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32 detector.ino
   arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyUSB0 --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32 detector.ino
   ```

3. **Adjust Detection Sensitivity**:
   ```
   # In the mobile app, go to Settings
   # Adjust Temperature Threshold (1.0-2.0°C recommended)
   # Adjust CO2 Threshold (150-250 ppm recommended)
   # Higher values = lower sensitivity, fewer false positives
   # Lower values = higher sensitivity, potentially more false positives
   ```

## Detection Theory

The Bed Bug Detector works based on several scientific principles:

1. **Temperature Sensing**: Bed bugs produce heat as they cluster, creating detectable temperature variations
2. **CO2 Detection**: Bed bugs emit carbon dioxide, which can be detected in higher concentrations near infestations
3. **Motion Detection**: Bed bug activity creates minute movement patterns that can be picked up by sensitive PIR sensors
4. **Visual Identification**: Camera imaging combined with machine learning algorithms for visual confirmation

For optimal detection:

- Use the detector during times of peak bed bug activity (typically 1am-5am)
- Position the detector near suspected areas (mattress seams, box springs, bed frames)
- Allow sufficient time (2-3 minutes) for the sensors to stabilize in each location
- Calibrate the detector regularly in known bed bug-free environments
- Use multiple detection points to triangulate potential infestation sites

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Detection Process

1. **Preparation**:
   ```
   # Ensure the detector is fully charged
   # Calibrate in a clean area
   # Plan your inspection areas (focus on sleeping areas and furniture)
   ```

2. **Scanning**:
   ```
   # Place the detector in the target area
   # Allow 2-3 minutes for sensor readings to stabilize
   # Press "Start Detection Scan" in the app
   # Wait for the scan to complete (approximately 30 seconds)
   # View the results and recommendations
   ```

3. **Visual Confirmation**:
   ```
   # If a positive detection occurs, use the camera function
   # Press "Capture Image" in the app
   # Examine the image for visual signs of bed bugs
   # The app will highlight potential bed bugs using image recognition
   ```

4. **Documentation**:
   ```
   # All scans are automatically saved in the History tab
   # Export scan history as a PDF report (optional)
   # Mark locations of positive detections for treatment
   ```

### Detection Tips

- **Multiple Locations**: Scan at least 5-7 locations around each piece of furniture
- **Regular Monitoring**: Perform scans weekly in high-risk environments
- **After Travel**: Always scan luggage and bedding after traveling
- **New Furniture**: Scan any used furniture before bringing it into your home
- **Early Morning**: Most accurate results are obtained between 1am-5am when bed bugs are most active

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Problem | Possible Causes | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **Detector won't power on** | Dead battery, loose connections | Charge battery, check all connections |
| **No WiFi network appears** | ESP32 firmware issue | Reflash firmware, check power connections |
| **Cannot connect to WiFi** | Password mismatch | Verify you're using the correct password (default: "detector123") |
| **Sensors show no readings** | Connection issues, component damage | Verify connections, replace component if necessary |
| **False positives** | Improper calibration, interference | Recalibrate in clean area, move away from heat sources |
| **Camera not working** | Loose cable, incorrect pins | Check camera ribbon cable, verify pin connections |
| **App crashes** | Dependencies, version issues | Clear app cache, reinstall app |
| **Short battery life** | Power-hungry settings, battery issues | Use deep sleep mode, replace battery |

### Diagnostic Commands

For technical users, you can diagnose issues using Termux or a serial connection:

```bash
# Check ESP32 serial output
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

# Check WiFi settings
curl http://192.168.4.1/sensor-data

# Test sensor readings
curl http://192.168.4.1/calibrate

# Reset detector to factory settings
curl -X POST http://192.168.4.1/reset
```

### LED Status Indicators

The detector uses LED status codes to indicate various states:

- **Solid Green**: System operational, no detection
- **Flashing Green**: Calibration in progress
- **Solid Red**: Bed bug activity detected
- **Flashing Red**: Error state, check app for details
- **Alternating Red/Green**: Low battery
